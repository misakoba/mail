# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

# Other hidden directories
.github/
.mypy_cache/
.pytest_cache/

# Ignored by the build system
/setup.cfg

# Exclude patterns from .gitignore:
#!include:.gitignore

# Ignore everything but the frozen run requirements
requirements_to_freeze/
requirements-test.txt

# Testing code and config
